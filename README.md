# PHP-MySQL-Project---DreamHome - found here : http://cs1.ucc.ie/~jd23/dreamhome.html
a basic site in PHP
This is my site that goes through about 20 PHP-Based pages as samples on how to navigate a database with queries of varying difficulty. 

The only thing I altered was my connection passwords on dreamconnect.php and dreamsetup.php
